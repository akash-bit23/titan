# Titan

Titan is a simple and extensible framework for building Clojure web applications.
Whether you're new to Clojure or an experienced Clojurist, Titan can help you
develop quickly and with delight.

*Titan is guided by the following core principles:*

 - Simple is better than complex
 - Clarity is better than cleverness
 - Build for extension: everything should compose.

## Getting Started

If you're getting started from scratch, you can quickly create a new Titan
project by using the Titan Leiningen template:

```
lein new titan-app APPNAME
```

If you're looking to configure an existing application with Titan, we recommend
taking a look at our [integration
guide](https://venantius.github.io/titan/#adding-titan-to-an-existing-app).
